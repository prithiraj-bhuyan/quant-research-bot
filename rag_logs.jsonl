Unlike factor timing strategies, regime analysis does not aim to predict when a regime shift will occur, but rather to identify when it has occurred, enabling investors to adapt their allocations accordingly [1]. By incorporating regime-switching signals into the Black-Litterman model, investors can construct a dynamic allocation strategy that outperforms a static approach, enhancing key metrics such as the information ratio and Sharpe ratio while reducing maximum drawdown [1], [2]. This is because regime-switching models can identify bull and bear market regimes for individual factors, allowing for more accurate and robust allocation decisions [2].
